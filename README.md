# Temp-reading-in-the-cloud
An implementation of a temperature reading in the cloud on an Arduino MKR1000 for UNLV CpE 417 Internet of Things project

# Overview
For the CpE 417 project, a temperature reading in the cloud was designed and tested on an arduino MKR1000, breadboard and Thinhspeak. The purpose of the project was to get data from the temperature sensor then send it to the cloud. Then from there is display a graph in Thingspeak show the data and it would update every 15 seconds.
